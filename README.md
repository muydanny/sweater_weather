# Sweater Weather

## Project Description

For this project I built an application to plan road trips. This app allows users to see the current weather as well as the forecasted weather at the destination.

This app has a service-oriented architecture. The front-end communicates with the back-end through an API. My job was to expose that API that satisfies the front-end teamâ€™s requirements.

## Learning Goals

Expose an API that aggregates data from multiple external APIs

Expose an API that requires an authentication token

Expose an API for CRUD functionality

Determine completion criteria based on the needs of other developers

Research, select, and consume an API based on your needs as a developer
